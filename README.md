# Cancer Bioinformatics Portfolio
A portfolio of independent reproducible bioinformatic analyses of public cancer genomic datasets.

This repository contains my independent bioinformatics projects analysing publicly available cancer genomics datasets. Each project is stored in the 'projects/' folder with code, data, and figures. A Quarto website provides a readable overview of all projects.
