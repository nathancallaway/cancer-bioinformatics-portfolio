# cancer-bioinformatics-portfolio
Reproducible bioinformatic analyses of public cancer genomic datasets.

This repository contains my independent bioinformatics projects analysing publicly available cancer genomics datasets. Each project is stored in the 'projects/' folder with code, data, and figures. A Quarto website provides a readable overview of all projects.
